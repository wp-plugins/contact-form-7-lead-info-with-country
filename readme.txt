Contact Form 7 Lead Info with country helps to track users that fill in forms. 

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 Lead info with country is an **addon module for the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin**. It helps you track the user who fills out a form.
All you need to do is add the [tracking-info] shortcode in the Message body of the contact form 7.

This plugin is an enhanced version of the plugin [Contact Form 7 Leads Tracking](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-leads-tracking/), that includes translations and the lookup of the country of the IP from which the form is sent.

We decided to create this enhanced version of the plugin, because we needed a translation to Spanish and wanted to know the country from which the uses send the contact form, whithout having to lookup the IP adress.

The lead tracking info includes: Form Page URL, Original Referrer, Landing Page, User IP, Country of the User IP and Browser.

In order to display the Country it needs the [GeoIP Detection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/) that can be found in the WordPress plugin repository. This plugin "provides geographic information detected by an IP adress". *This plugin auto-updates the GeoIP database once a week. This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from [www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com).*

If the [GeoIP Detection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/) is not installed and enabled, you will only see the IP address, without the country of the IP adress.

We decided to use the GEOIP DETECTION plugin to handle the lookup of the country, because it's a plugin that is actively developed and we saw no advantage in implementing all this functionality, when we could use an existing one.

The lead tracking info in this plugin includes:

1. **Form Page URL**
    The URL on which the user filled out the form.

1. **Original Referrer**
    The URL from which the user came to your site.

1. **Landing Page**
    The first page the user visited on your site.

1. **User IP**
    The IP address of the user who filled out the form.

1. **Country of the IP**
    The country of the IP address of the user who filled out the form. If the country is 0, please check the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-lead-info-with-country/faq/) information.
	
1. **User Agent / Browser**
    The browser information of the user who filled the form.

= Plugin doesn't seem to work. No information is displayed in the email received by Contact Form 7 =
In order to make this plugin work, you need to insert the shortcode [tracking-info] in the Message Body of the contact form. If you don't insert the shortcode [tracking-info] the info will not be added. It's made like this so that you can decide in which contact forms you want to display the info.

Contact Form 7 Lead info with country is an **addon module for the Contact Form 7 plugin**. You need to have [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) installed and active.

In order to display the Country it needs the [GeoIP Detection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/) that can be found in the WordPress plugin repository. This plugin "provides geographic information detected by an IP adress". *This plugin auto-updates the GeoIP database once a week. This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from [www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com).*

If the [GeoIP Detection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/) is not installed and enabled, you will only see the IP address, without the country of the IP adress.

IMPORTANT: When you install the GeoIP Detection plugin for the first time, it's important that you go to Tools > GeoIP Detection and click on "Upgrade now". When activated the plugin does not download the GeoIP database automatically. You have to download it the first time by clicking on "Upgrade now".

== Translating WordPress Plugins ==

The steps involved in translating a plugin are:

1. Run a tool over the code to produce a POT file (Portable Object Template), simply a list of all localizable text. Our plugins allready havae this POT file in the /languages/ folder.
1. Use a plain text editor or a special localization tool to generate a translation for each piece of text. This produces a PO file (Portable Object). The only difference between a POT and PO file is that the PO file contains translations.
1. Compile the PO file to produce a MO file (Machine Object), which can then be used in the theme or plugin.

In order to translate a plugin you will need a special software tool like [poEdit](http://www.poedit.net/), which is a cross-platform graphical tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

The naming of your PO and MO files is very important and must match the desired locale. The naming convention is: `language_COUNTRY.po` and plugins have an additional naming convention whereby the plugin name is added to the filename: `pluginname-fr_FR.po`

That is, the plugin name name must be the language code followed by an underscore, followed by a code for the country (in uppercase). If the encoding of the file is not UTF-8 then the encoding must be specified. 

For example:

* en_US for US English
* en_UK for UK English
* es_ES for Spanish from Spain
* fr_FR for French from France
* zh_CN for Simplified Chinese

A list of language codes can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639), and country codes can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). A full list of encoding names can also be found at [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets).
